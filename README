This is the source code that runs Flickr For Busy Peopl (ffbp):

ffbp is a Flickr API (web) application that runs on the Google AppEngine (GAE)
platform:

http://flickrforbusypeople.appspot.com

It asks the Flickr API for the list of your contacts who have uploaded photos in
the last 30 minutes, two hours, four hours and eight hours. If you click on the
buddyicon for a contact, the application will display thumbnails of those
photos.

You can choose to display all your contacts or only friends and family but
otherwise that's all it does.

I find it tremendously useful for keeping up with my contacts uploads,
especially those people who are awake and using Flickr while I am asleep. Your
mileage may vary.

REQUIREMENTS

If you want to run your own version of ffbp, you will need:

* A valid Flickr API key, registered as a web application. Both the API key and
  the application secret will need to be added to the config.py file.

  If you don't have a Flickr API key, you can get one here:

  http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/

* A valid GAE account and a recent version of the GAE SDK for Python (>= 1.2.3)
  which can be downloaded from:

  http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

* The gae-FlickrApp package
